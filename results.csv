0,How to get good Algorithms and Data Structures for Coding Interview,"Hey, so I just finished my first term as a CS major and managed land a medicore internship for my first coop term this summer. I want to get better at algorithms and data structure to hopefully one day land that Cali internship. Anybody got some advice on where I should start, what resources I should use to learn (ideally for python), and what their study plan was? I have seen so many recommendations on various different books and courses online but I was just wondering what other people do?

Note: I am proficient in python not sure if that is good fit for coding interviews or learning DS and Algos (seen recommendations towards Java and C++).",https://www.reddit.com/r/uwaterloo/comments/gomj1g/how_to_get_good_algorithms_and_data_structures/,gomj1g
1,Incoming exchange student,"Hi there, I am from an Australian university, planning to do my exchange to Waterloo in Winter 2020. Here are the courses that I intend to take up during the exchange:

CS349: User Interfaces

CS456: Computer Networks

one math course

one algorithm/data structure related course

Here are my questions:

1. What are the recommended high-quality courses in Waterloo?
2. Any important pre-requisites for CS349 user interface?
3. It seems like CS350 OS is a pre-requisite for CS456. I'm learning OS in my home institution that is taught in C, but the OS course in Waterloo is taught is C++. Would there be any issues if I were to take up this CS456 without having knowledge in C++? What do I need to know before taking up CS456?
4. Any recommended math-course that has an emphasis on proving?
5. Any recommended algorithm/data structure related course? 
6. How is the CS251 Computer Organization and Design course? What will I learn in that course? Anything I need to know before taking this?

4,First co-op in ECE: What should I know?," Hey all, 

I'm going into ECE in September and I got placed into  Stream 4, which is currently poised to be during a lackluster economy at  best. Needless to say, I'm a little worried, I want a co-op bad so I'm  starting to prepare now. The question here is, what should I know to  maximize  my chances? Specifically any programming languages, libraries  and fundamental data structure/algorithm stuff. What technical skills  are companies looking for in a 1A co-op? 

Currently, I'm working on JS and MERN. I have a grounding  of the foundations of programming and JS, so atm I'm familiarizing  myself with MERN through a project and whenever I'm bored with that  working on data structures and algorithms in JS. I also know a fair bit  of HTML/CSS and basic C++. Am I heading in the right direction? 

Thanks for any responses in advance! This is a rather stressful way to start off university but I'm hoping  for the best.",https://www.reddit.com/r/uwaterloo/comments/h8n4ua/first_coop_in_ece_what_should_i_know/,h8n4ua

9,How to prepare for data science interviews?,"I’ve gotten a couple DS interviews so far and they range from anywhere from 30 min to 1 hour, which makes me think some of them won’t be too heavy on technical stuff.

Do you practice leetcode? Or data manipulation questions using SQL/Python/R? 

Are the SQL questions pretty standard (I.e hackerrank level) or insanely complex? 

How well do you have to know data structures and some associated algorithms? 

What kind of probability/stats questions are asked? Is it basic stuff or very mathematical? 

Have you ever gotten case studies or something similar?

12,BS in EE to MS in CS,"Hey everyone,

I'm posting this for myself and anyone who may find this information helpful. If this post is not unique and is too similar to another post in this subreddit, please let me know and I will remove this post. Anyways, let's get started.

First, a little about me. I completed my BS in EE in a no-name university in America where I managed to get research experience in computer vision under NSF funding, work as a full-stack developer for a local start up, and maintained a 3.8 GPA. The CS courses taken during my EE degree were programming in C, data structures, introduction to machine learning, and introduction to quantum computing. After college, I worked as a data scientist in NY. Currently, I am a master's student in Georgia Tech's OMSCS program. While this program is great and have no complaints, I'm a permanent resident in Canada on track to citizenship and it is a non-thesis option. I want to eventually pursue a PhD in CS here. Therefore, I am looking to move to a university in Canada like UofT or UofW. My concern is that my BS is in EE, and therefore unsure how competitive I am as an applicant to UofT or UofW.

Since this is a UofW subreddit, I'll keep this post specific to UofW's CS department.

Is there anyone who managed to go from a BS in EE (from UofW or any other university) to an MS in CS at UofW? What do you feel helped you get accepted into a CS graduate program at UofW given your BS wasn't in CS? Any advice for others doing the same? Finally, considering the background I have (if more info is needed, I can provide), is it common for those like me to get admitted to UofW's graduate program in CS?

Disclaimer: For anyone reading this who may or may not be in my position, note that at times graduate admission can be out of everyone's control. Very good applicants can still not get in. This post is to help myself and others to see their relative odds in admission to UofT's graduate program in CS given their BS degree (though may be related) is not in CS specifically. There is no guarantee of admission in any person's case.

Thanks to everyone in advance for any input or advice, I really appreciate it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/uwaterloo/comments/gzdw7u/bs_in_ee_to_ms_in_cs/,gzdw7u

15,I am in CS and have absolutely no related experience. How can I get my first coop job?,"I am in 2A CS. My current CAV is 77%. My first coop term is this summer. The only CS related experience I have is from CS135 and CS136. I actually did fairly well in CS136 and got 88% in it. But this is all that I have, nothing else. Even from CS136, I don't really know how to code/program, I just did well because I had a good understanding of the data structures that were taught like linked lists and arrays. I am taking CS246 this term, but am not sure how much useful information I can learn before I apply to coop jobs and do interviews. I have no side projects, and I do not believe that I possess the prerequisite knowledge to make side projects. I did not even do anything CS related in high school.  

I just checked out WW, and all the job postings seem daunting. They want you to know all sorts of different programming languages and frameworks, and some even ask for past experience. Mind you, the only job postings I was looking at were for QA, analyst, and testing positions. For my first coop, I only want to apply for these positions in the GTA since they are related to CS and are (hopefully) not insanely hard to get as a first coop. I am not even trying to go to cali or anything like that. All of these positions have only a few openings (some have only one opening), and the number of applicants either equals or exceeds available positions. All job postings for first round seem to have an application deadline for next week. Even if I start learning now, I don't feel like there will be enough time to learn what I need in time to apply. There is always continuous round, but I feel like the same will be true. Are my chances at getting a coop job next term completely hopeless? It seems as if everyone else in CS has been programming in their own time during high school and have some side projects, while I don't have anything.

There is SOME silver lining. I do have some work and volunteer experience, but its what everyone did in high school, and nothing at all related to CS. I was a receptionist for two summers, so I have experience working in an ""office setting"" and working with office equipment (not sure how much this really counts for). For one summer, I was a summer camp counsellor (which probably doesn't mean anything). During my high school years, I was a member of the youth council at my local community centre. So yeah, average high school kid stuff... 

What can I do to salvage this situation and still get a mediocre QA/testing/analyst job? I don't want to settle for anything lower since I wan't a coop job for the experience, not for the money. I should also be taking proactive measures over the next few months so I am in a better position for my second coop term.",https://www.reddit.com/r/uwaterloo/comments/epdnlk/i_am_in_cs_and_have_absolutely_no_related/,epdnlk

20,Interview/advice,"Hello,

I applied to a Google internship about a week ago. I got into the second stage where they send me two coding questions. I completed those and got scheduled for a phone interview next week. The two questions, they were leetcode easy, but I found them rather hard and took me almost an hour to solve them. 

I am really considering canceling the phone interview and just say fuck it. I tried practicing some leetcode, I tried the basic twosum question, and was able to complete it in about 30 minutes. 

My Ds&A skills are pretty rusty and leetcode isnt much help. I ordered CTCI and hopefully that will teach me all the necessary stuff I need to be able to do leetcode easy.

At the same time, I’m thinking I should do the phone interview since I’ve never had a developer coop and would like to see if it’s something I see doing after graduation, or If I should pursue a more non programming path. 

Help please, how fucked am I?

22,Computer vs Civil Engineering,"Ok, so this happened the other day and it has been bothering me. 

I was over at a friends house for his birthday. There were other people from my grad class there as well. So theres this other guy, who is going into trackone at Uoft and planning to major in Civil engineering after first year (lol!), and Im going to UWaterloo for Computer Engineering in less than 2 months. 

We kind of got into a debate on Computer vs civil Engineering. It kind of heated up and I KNOW for a fact that Computer Engineering is harder and more employable than civil engineering, but he claims otherwise. He says ""computer engineering is lots of coding, which is just typing, and circuits are easier than structures and dynamics"". I say ""a lot of coding are high level algorithms which are math, and circuits are math as well"" He says ""yeah but civil is applied math into dynamics and forces, circuits are easier than dynamics"". It essentially went like that. Im not the best debater, so I didnt have too much to counter it, but in the end He made a more convincing arguments to other people there (people who are going into like business and stuff who have no idea) and there was kind of a mumbling agreement that civil sounds harder. I know circuits is hard but HOW is it hard. I know for a fact that Computer Engineering is the SECOND hardest engineering discipline (easier than Software Engineering, but harder than Mechanical (which is 3rd)). 

There is no doubt Ill see him again later on this summer before we all go of to school, so can someone who is familiar with the difficulty of Computer Engineering and someone who is familiar with the easiness of civil engineering please tell me some points so i can roast his @ss when I see him next?

30,I made a huge mistake going into engineering here.,"I just really hate engineering. I honestly think it’s a scam. This is going to be a long one.

People will keep telling you “we always need more engineers”, but that’s honestly a lie. There’s either too many engineers graduating, too few jobs being created, too few people retiring, or all of those factors acting together simultaneously. For example, Professional Engineers Ontario made a report on the low rate of license engineers working in engineering, titled “Crisis in Ontario’s Engineering Labour Market: Underemployment Among Ontario’s Engineering-Degree Holders”, where they show statistics detailing a 31 % rate of licensed engineering actually working in engineering-related work in Ontario.

Now, people will argue “but engineers move into management or switch careers over their lifetime,” but I don’t particularly accept that argument. Why? Because if you have an engineering degree, you really should be doing engineering-related work, that’s what you’re licensed for. Most engineers don’t actually become managers, only a select portion with many years of experience, or possibly those who complete an MBA, can become involved in management. I can’t get into a coding job from an engineering job, I can’t get a finance job from an engineering job, it just doesn’t make sense unless you have some very powerful connections or do a lot of self-study. I’m simply not eligible to gain access into other professional societies without that kind of educational background. If you go to the job fair as a chemical engineer and try to talk to a tech company, you’ll get laughed out of there. Sure, if you self-studied I’m certain you can talk to them to an extent, but in the end they’ll want you to get out of there as quickly as possible to make room for an “actual candidate”. But all of these kinds of people who transitioned from engineering can’t possibly make up the remaining 69 %. In fact, in the same report, a significant portion of engineers are working in fields that don’t require degrees. Huh.

As for myself, I really don’t think I have the special “personality” for engineering. It’s a shame, but that’s the way the world works – it’s like a room full of cliques, and if you’re not part of our group you’re against us. That’s the kind of mentality that plagues society nowadays.

Anyways, I really loved the engineering curriculum. But for the life of me, it’s got nothing to do with actual engineering, from the six co-op positions I’ve worked in. Seriously, solving these differential equations and solving all of the mathematical problems/models associated with engineering – it’s really got absolutely nothing to do with actual engineering!

Seriously, I’m in my final year, taking a few courses that are mixed undergraduate/graduate courses, and I’m being bombarded by graduate students asking how I do so well. But, solving these math problems – it’s like solving Sudoku or a Rubik’s cube, once you understand the basic rules of what you can and cannot do, you can pretty much solve anything, even without “studying” too intensely, it's like puzzles. It bewilders me that people just spend so much time studying. As difficult as this may be for most to believe, I found high school harder than university primarily because actually learning what calculus was, for instance, was harder to me than actually just learning a few new rules in calculus. In engineering, compared to other programs, your marks barely matter at all.

Sure, at the big companies and federal government agencies will do a quick run over your marks, but for the most part, your marks don’t even matter at all! Graduate engineering supervisors will happily waive the GPA requirements in most cases if you have a good connection with a professor! It’s like companies pretty much recognize that the academics of engineering is pretty much useless! I’ve only seen marks matter when it comes to getting those NSERC grants for money, otherwise it’s worthless!

Many students know this as well, and will only try to barely pass their courses and spend their time to make connections – those are the smart ones. It really saddens me to see my friends who barely pass, who party everyday, drink and smoke, swear and act foolish during our breaks, getting involved with the great engineering companies that I wouldn’t ever be able to work for, not even in my most pleasant dreams. I won’t lie, I am jealous, but deep down I’m happy for them. Yet, I just can’t shake that nagging feeling that it’s just not right. I honestly studied hard each day and enjoyed the course material earnestly. BUT, I don’t have the best “personality”. At the same time, I’m not a “freak”, either. Either way, I’m not going to win a personality contest, though, and that’s pretty much what many interviews boil down to.

Let’s illustrate with an example. I’m not going to get a nice girl from a bar from just talking to her through the “power of words”, I’m not playing a Fallout game with 100 speech, I’m going to have to purposely play with my car keys to show my influence/power. Not joking. Seriously, I used to live in an apartment just a little far away from the school, and the number of women approaching me in the parking lot was…staggering. It’s like they were waiting for me from their window and ran outside as soon as I was leaving to leave with me. Those kind of women over the course of my education wanted to get into a relationship, but I could tell they just wanted to use my car for getting to school and for transporting groceries, etc. What I’m trying to say is that I had leverage over those situations because I had something that someone else really needed. But with these engineering jobs, I simply don’t. It’s like police, they have extremely powerful unions because they have certain skills that most of the population doesn’t have.

But all this math has nothing to do with engineering! On my co-ops, I pretty much just pushed a button and waited for results all day! Seriously, our program doesn’t teach you how to screw in screws all day, like what I was doing all day in one of my co-op positions. It certainly doesn’t teach you how to pack your instruments into cardboard boxes, print/affix mailing labels, and tape up those boxes and deliver them to the UPS fellow, which is what I did all day in another one of my co-op positions! Doesn’t teach you how to lie and deceive your customers like your boss forces you to, and then deal with them when they perform hundreds of calls complaining about the level of service they received. Doesn’t teach you how to deal with a bunch of foreign workers, laughing like hyenas you in front of your face while speaking their own language. Doesn’t teach you how to say “no” to unsafe work practices, which is the saddest of them all.

The laboratory and its associated content DO involve real engineering work, but in my particular faculty, chemical engineering, the laboratory courses were a joke. Seriously, it’s literally a monopoly run by the three laboratory instructors, trying to make it look like it has the credentials to fulfil the engineering requirements for the program to be accredited. In every laboratory, it was literally pushing the button of a 30-year old instrument and waiting for results, then pushing another button, waiting for results, plotting the two lines on top of each other, and explaining the difference. I recycled most of my lab reports from each other due to how similar everything was. When I was doing co-ops earlier at Waterloo, I literally found myself exaggerating to interviewers because of how much of a joke our laboratory courses were compared to other faculties. Perhaps it’s different and better for other faculties, but in ours it was a joke that was simply not funny. I found it really awful when I was working with physics and chemistry students, who would spend hours discussing their old laboratories with supervisors during my co-op. I’d just be standing there, flabbergasted, barely able to keep up with the discussions they were having.

A few of my latter work terms dealt with a very niche topic, which I had no idea about and did not have the option of taking electives in since you can’t even take any technical electives when you have most of your co-ops since you’re only in first to third year. In chemical engineering, you pretty much can’t take any technical electives until fourth year, which really sucks if you’re in fourth-stream because you walk into many early co-op positions with just your calculus and physics (mechanics!) knowledge and look like a joke to employers. I think it depends on your graduating year, though, some years you do have space to take electives in 3B, but in our term, we didn’t. Man, at my earlier positions, I literally had to spend all night, as soon as I got home from work, just studying literature about that niche topic, a topic my program had taught me nothing about. Even then, I struggled to keep up with the meetings and discussions, whereas the students in other programs just knew not only about it from the top of their head, they knew potential consequences of it too and were able to easily use their advanced knowledge to solve practical problems on the spot. Hilariously during those first few weeks, I was actually mistaken as the chemistry student and the other fellow was mistaken as the chemical engineering student.

Yet, where does all the tuition money go? Why do I pay, as an engineering student, three times the tuition of a chemistry student, yet get barely any practical laboratories? I’m not going to sugar coat it like all those events, during my first few work terms I would spend many hours after work just sitting alone in the room I rented, crying and drinking until I could get to sleep during the whole work term because of how much both my supervisors and fellow co-op students ridiculed me. You try talking to the work councillor they assign to you, and perhaps some of them are good, but mine pretty much told me to “deal with it”. When I asked what would happen if I quit after the required 12 weeks, they would still give you awful answers and still force you to try not to quit and threaten you by not giving you the co-op credit. See, at Waterloo, you need to complete the five required work terms if you want to graduate, you can fail many academic courses just fine, but if you don’t have enough work term credits, you’ll need to delay your graduation. You see a big issue here: if you end up getting bullied around during your work term and don’t get a credit, you will be significantly punished, even if it’s an issue outside of your control. Of course people who violate safety regulations should be punished, but what if the company you’re working at is sketchy and small, a company you were forced to work with because you really had no other option? What if they can’t even afford to power the fumehood that you’re using to pour acid under? What if you were never trained for a process, and when you ask for help they threaten you, saying that you lied in the interview when you know that you didn’t? That’s the kind of experience I’ve had during my co-op terms. Academics was the only thing I was good at, and the only thing that caused others to feigned that they actually liked me so that they could use me to complete their assignments. I loved academic terms because I could see the pain in everyone’s face, just feigning that they liked me so they could get some notes or assignments and running away afterwards.

The worst part is the fourth-year design project. You pay $9000 for four months of tuition, and you know what the budget is for your final project? I think it’s about $10 for printing your poster, haha. Talk about a slap in the face. Since most of your professors are actually part-time employees who aren’t actually professors, good luck actually getting friendly with a professor to get extra funds due to the abysmal student:professor ratio.

I’ve applied to many full-time positions, both outside and inside waterlooworks and have attending several career fairs. I was literally getting offered salaries of $12-13/hr in remote conditions, many of which required you to drive to different plant locations across Ontario without getting any percentage of gas reimbursed due to having to be put in a ""probation"" status until I've worked for 3 years at the company. I hate it when everyone else tells me, “Hey *, it’s only YOUR chem eng that’s bad, all other engineering is fine, you just picked the one with the worst prospects!” But it’s true, due to the dropping oil prices, people who've been in the industry for 20 years are accepting junior positions. Guess I just got unlucky, should've learnt how to play the guitar, haha. Most waterloo students seem to be able to pay of their debt, but I only had five co-ops compared to my eight academic semesters, where at each co-op I earned about $12-16/hr, so I still have about $20,000 left to pay after graduation. I expect many students are lying about their debt to look better socioeconomically with their peers.

Man, Waterloo engineering is a scam. Don’t get me wrong, the co-op positions are okay later on, but it’s really a situation of “your mileage may vary”. Most of my early co-ops were with customer support on the telephone and literally just taking instruments, packing them into boxes and shipping them out. My later co-ops shoehorned me into a niche industry I can’t find work for. Half of the places I did co-op positions have been shut down, while the other half literally laughed in my face when I asked if I could work full-time.

Why would they do that? From my experience, most companies in waterlooworks are just “co-op farms”, ie, they’re companies who just cycle through co-op students without hiring any full-time students. This is because when you’re a co-op student, the companies can get many tax breaks and such, but when you’re a full-time, you’re pretty much worthless. From what I’ve observed, companies would much rather take a risk in hiring an inexperienced co-op student than to hire a co-op student who’s worked at that same company for two or three co-op terms. Why? Because it’s all about the money in the end.

Don’t do engineering at Waterloo. Do something else, like some kind of service that people actually need. Do a trade and learn some practical skills. Man, I'm a fool.",https://www.reddit.com/r/uwaterloo/comments/go1w5v/i_made_a_huge_mistake_going_into_engineering_here/,go1w5v
31,It's only 1B. I feel terrible. I think I know why. I can't change it.,"So for context, I'm currently in SE 1B and, to put it lightly, I feel miserable. 

I was only able to admit it to myself today, but I think I have been feeling this way since the first two weeks of 1B. To my frustration, I can't pinpoint definitive reasons for why this might be; the causes are likely bunched up together. My first inclination was to think about how 1A went and recall if any harmful/alarming emotional thoughts originated during that semester. This was not the case; I was happy with my life in 1A.

I jumped to the obvious causes: I thought that maybe it was my failure to perform academically, to find a job, or some combination of both. Maybe. My grades have effectively halved since 1A (okay they didn't halve but they're pretty abysmal, like near-failing abysmal) and I am currently in continuous after receiving zero interviews. I get told to not compare myself to others, and I do my best to take this advice to heart, but in a program like SE it's so damn hard not to. It's hard to see my classmates barely give an effort to pay attention in class, or not go at all, only to see them ace their ECE 106 quizzes while I get handed a 4/10 almost every week. It's hard to see them land interview after interview, showing up every day to class in formal wear, while I continue to receive no interviews from my applications. However, despite the fact that I sit in awe of my classmates, I'm okay with the fact that I'm not as good as them. I have accepted that I'm not like most of my classmates, it will probably take a few years until I catch up to them in terms of my academic and career life. There's definitely more to being in SE 1B than merely having accomplished friends that have been keeping me down.

Lately, I have been getting the feeling that the SE department is trying to 'weed' the weaker classmates, like myself, out of the cohort in 1B instead of trying to support them. This is probably not their intention, but it's the *feeling* I'm getting. To explain why I feel this way, I'm going to write things that SE's will relate best to, so if you're not in SE I'll do my best to communicate to you what's going on. There have been a few courses, especially the ones that start with the code 'ECE' that I am convinced are purposely designed to make the 'weaker' fail. 

I don't know how you ECE students do it, I'm only sharing half your course load this semester and I can't even take it, you guys have my full respect. Recently I had a prof explain to my class why he purposely tries to make the midterm ridiculously hard (the class average was 57% this year, and that was high apparently smh). To his defense, part of the reason is so he can justify making an easier final exam, but I don't see why it is necessary to have half the class failing and inevitably in a perpetual state of anxiety until final exams, our second and final chance to rescue our grade, is over. We also had another course with a ridiculously hard and long midterm, so unreasonable to the point where the class reps brought it up with the prof and the SE director, only to have the director send an email to the class effectively saying the third and fourth years have it worse (and they probably do have it worse, I'm not going to begin to claim they don't) but our outrage is not understandable and our concerns are overblown. I *know* this exam was designed to make people fail, and not just to fail those who never went to class or studied, but even those who made honest efforts to do the problem sets and pay attention in class. 

I knew, everybody knew, that calling SE 'demanding' is the understatement of a lifetime. This program is brutally busy. There should be no concept of free time, you are either studying or conditioning your body for more studying (aka sleeping). I used to be heavily involved in extracurricular activities: the president of a few clubs, participating in multiple coding/business competitions and played sports. Now, look at me. If I try to slack off for an hour, like going out for dinner with my friends, I just guaranteed that I will fail my calculus quiz tomorrow. Whenever I go shopping, let's say, I can't focus on having fun because I know I should be at home doing my ECE 140 homework. The worst part is that I have asked my classmates if they felt the same and, to my horror, not only do they say they feel the same, but they willingly accept it because 'this is what SE does to you.' Living like this has brought questions like 'what is the point of living' or 'what is this all leading up to' and I can never conjure a satisfactory answer for myself. I was led to believe that university was supposed to be the best years of my life, so someone please tell me why it's feeling like the complete opposite so far. 

Reading back on the giant block of text I wrote (I'm sorry for the long read) I realize I failed to illustrate how much this program is kicking me while I'm down: it's hard to put these things into words, but I wrote this post on a throwaway for a reason. There have been times where if you gave me a gun, I would strongly consider ending it all, and then there are the moments afterward where I am horrified and frightened that I considered it. I have never felt this way in my life. I was always a happy person until 1B where I am now feeling uncontrollable bursts of sadness and hopelessness, perhaps depression. I am horrified that I am feeling this way, these feelings are completely foreign, I've never experienced a feeling of sadness of this magnitude until now. 

The worst part is that I don't want to spend time seeking counseling or help. I've already made the mistake of seeking a doctor when I was sick two weeks before midterms, and that doctor's visit took away crucial time to study for my calculus and ECE 106 quizzes, which I did very poorly on. I know you would all tell me to prioritize my health over school, and maybe take some time off, but failing or falling behind in SE would put me in an infinitely worse and directionless spot than I am in right now (ironic right).

I'm not sure what the point of writing all this was. On the one hand, it's good to see some of my thoughts materialized into words. On the other, it has made me feel so much more hopeless about what I can do to improve my SE experience. Some upper years have told me SE only gets worse. If that truly is the case, I have no clue what the hell I can do with my life; I can already see myself feeling stuck. I'm hoping you guys can tell me that what I'm going through isn't going to harm me in the end and that there is a way out of this ever-deepening hole.

33,A few tips for applying to co-op jobs - from an employer,"First, I have to say I was overwhelmed by the number of people who applied for our two positions. There's so much talent available and I'm messaging every company owner I know in the hopes they'll hire more UW co-ops.

After reviewing over 200 applications, I have some advice for those of you applying for co-op jobs.

Who made the short-list, and why?

1. Make sure you are actually relevant for the position. If the position is for a Marketing Intern and you're a programmer, tweak your resume. Why do your skills lend themselves to the position? Just wildly posting your resume to every last job is a sure way to get lost in the shuffle. As a hiring manager, I may look at an applicant for 30 seconds or less. 
2. Don't talk about your grades first. Talk about your real-world results. 
3. Don't make your resume into an eye-chart with size 7 fonts and paragraphs of text. I had two applicants for one position - one gave me a paragraph all about a course they took, and one gave me a 1-sentence point about how their work resulted in a 33% increase in X. Who do you think I selected for an interview?
4. Make your cover letter relevant to the job. Even better if in the first paragraph you can tell me why your past experience makes you a good fit for the job. Show me you understand my pain. Don't just tell me about your past experience - I'll just say ""so what?"" *Show me the so what!*
5. Don't attach your term paper for me to read. It looks awesome but I don't have the time.
6. Tell me what you did at your past jobs, and tell me *why it mattered.* What were the *results*? Did you decrease turnaround time by 30%? Did you increase engagement by 15%? Did you help the team ship code faster by 2 weeks on average? *Everybody can work as part of a dynamic group and reduce overheads,* or some other generic jargon. Why did what you do matter? What were the results?

tl;dr: Talk about your results. Customize your cover letter. Don't give employers an eye chart to read. Make sure your skills are relevant to the job. And talk about your results! Those matter the most - if I see you can talk about the results of your work, that demonstrates to me that you can see the big picture and understand why what you do *matters*.

Good luck out there!",https://www.reddit.com/r/uwaterloo/comments/g649hl/a_few_tips_for_applying_to_coop_jobs_from_an/,g649hl
34,How do we stop this?,"I really did not want to make this thread for fear of sounding like a ""feminazi"" but this has really been bothering me. Last Wednesday in my CS350 class, before it had started and as people were walking in to find their seat, I couldn't help but overhear a group of guys having this conversation: (Please forgive me as the words are not exact, but the overall message and sentiment is accurate)

*Guy 1:* Did you hear about how x (a girl's name) got interviews for Google, Facebook, and Palantir and I swear she doesn't even know how to code

*Guy 2:* *(Laughing)* I think all of the girls in software hardly know how to code, they only get hired to fulfill quotas

This was only a small bit of what they were saying. Why do guys in Computer Science and other STEM programs have this infuriating sexist mindset? The funny thing is that I would not even call myself a feminist. I'm a relatively chill person. I don't get affected by much and I understand people can say whatever they want, but when I overheard that I started to feel like a fraud... I'm not the best at coding but I really try my hardest and I like to think I am doing well enough given I'm in third year Computer Science. But hearing stuff like that really makes me question whether I'm good enough to be here... I couldn't pay attention afterwards in class and I started to really doubt myself and whether I should have even been here after class. After talking about this with my mom, I realized that none of it is my fault. It's not my fault that I was born a female. I didn't ask for any of this just as none of you asked for being born a male - or being born at all. Why can't we all just get past this and realize that our gender doesn't dictate our abilities? I know a lot of guys in Computer Science are not like this, and a lot of you are advocates of equality and diversity, but I just wanted to make this thread for anyone else feeling what I felt. It's not your fault and you do belong here. Don't ever get discouraged by other people's negativity. I want to open a dialogue about this and invite all sides: why does sexism exist in STEM to the degree that it does? And what can we do to help mitigate it? Thanks for reading and sorry for the long post. I just really want to share how I feel about this topic. I know it can be sensitive.",https://www.reddit.com/r/uwaterloo/comments/fephdk/how_do_we_stop_this/,fephdk

There are only 4 other developers, 3 of which are older than 60 and are just learning how to use git. The company has no QA team, no development cycle, no code reviews, and no project breakdown / management (each person just has their own big project and nobody tracks or checks up on them). I don’t understand how they get anything done because it seems like they don’t really care about their work. 

The CEO just told me we’re going to be using a drag and drop platform to make 80% of a project I was told I will be able to make from scratch, which is the reason I joined the company in the first place.

I’m really worried I won’t learn any modern and useful programming practices from this and that I will end up wasting my time for 4 months and just be miserable.

41,"From getting kicked out, getting back in, almost failing again, graduating, and now a full time job. Trust me if i can do it, so can you.","So this is my story on how I had a very long, long journey from freshman Waterloo to a full time job that i love.

&#x200B;

I really wanted to write this at one point on this reddit to share how I went from failure to success.

&#x200B;

I started Waterloo back in 2011 Fall for Life Science, first time out of parents grasp I got to taste freedom. That uncontrollable freedom lead to my botching my first semester here, probably all thanks to League of Legends. At that point i had a choice to restart next year or go into a ""success"" term taking lighter course load and going from that. I chose to go with the success term. But I didn't change, the path of destruction continued and I was kicked out permanently from my faculty and the school.

&#x200B;

From this I went into severe depression over the summer but somewhat got back on track and went to college in my hometown. College was smooth sailing, but i felt very unchallenged and unfulfilled, even if i was doing very well i was not happy. With a year of college like that i decided to pick my self up again, if college was easy for me, I believe that i was that a university level. The next year I studied my ass off with a goal in mind, it was to get back into University of Waterloo. I wanted to get back in graduate from the school that once kicked me out. So i studied hard the next year, got close with the professor and even got letters of recommendation form them. I re-applied to UW and petitioned my way back in.

&#x200B;

In the Fall 2014 I was back where i started 3 years ago in 2011, i was given a probation semester with conditions to be met. And i met that probation by working my ass off for every single day and night and when i knew i made, it was pure joy. I knew i had it in me and i was able to do it.

&#x200B;

Semesters passed to semester 2B where things started to get hard and and I saw my friends graduating and started to get a job. This is when my second downward spiral began. I felt extremely depressed and was unmotivated to do my studies. I failed the semester but was able to stay in because I petitioned my way in.

&#x200B;

3A I was just trying to get by and was deciding on how I should move on with my academic life, I knew i wasn't getting in any higher education with my GPA, and the courses were only getting harder and harder. So i thought about it and decided to pursue a computer science minor because even with that, it is some certification that I can do something CS related. Everything was going well because I did like programming, but then I just could not pass the algebra course. University level math and I never saw eye to eye. But with taking basic sciences courses and CS courses I was able to make it through.

&#x200B;

After graduation, job hunting was not easy, my GPA was not there nor did i have any work experience in the field of CS. But i was determined to do this, because i knew if i couldn't succeed here, I will not be able to live my life the way i wanted. I self-studied more coding, and started creating portfolios and projects so that i can prove that i can code. With something to prove my resume has gotten more responsive and been getting calls to set up interview. If i did get the interview, I was able to make it the final round always. But it just ended there, after final round I would just get emails that they had decided to go with someone else. And I knew what the reason was, there was someone out there better than or someone that was similar to me but with work experiences. But I didnt give up, i tried and tried and kept trying for 8 months.

&#x200B;

Until it finally happened, I got hired and I was at the happiest moment ever in my life. Because I went through a perilous road that I put myself in and I made it out. Right now, I work as a full time at a software company. It is a small role but hey this is my first job, i got to start somewhere.

&#x200B;

I just want to tell the students of UW this. Life gets hard, life will bring you down, and sometimes you would want to end it. But don't do it, because you really do ruin the chance of getting it better and finding the happiness at the end. If something stands in your way, beat it down, if you can't just get a bigger stick and beat it down. You are never alone out there, people have gone through the same stuff you are going through right now and some people went through worse. Find the right people that will support you, and try to outgoing at the same time because I can tell you this right now, no matter how strong you think you are, having someone there will always make it better.

Be strong warriors and fight for the life that you want.

47,(HELP!) How to restart from the beginning for Stats?,"Hi, I'm in 3A Stats and I'm desperate for some advice from other Stats students.

So far I took STAT 230, 231, 330, 332, 333.

Currently I'm taking STAT 331 and STAT 442.

I feel like my academic life is in shambles so I'm here for advice (so far, I passed the previous courses luckily even though I never went to class/survived off of Learn notes). In the first 2 years, my stat grades were actually not that bad but I got a low 50 for STAT 333 and WD'd STAT 331 last term.

So far this term, I did well on STAT 331 assignments and not too bad on STAT 442 assignments but literally, I don't understand much from either courses. I just follow the code from the lectures/tutorials that are posted online and tweak it to see if it solves the problems in the assignments but don't really understand how it works or why I'm using it.

As a result, I did poorly on the midterms (60 on STAT 442 midterm, probably a low 50 on STAT 331 midterm).

What study strategies can I implement to actually learn/absorb these materials from scratch? I'm not too stressed about the grades as long as I pass but I'm worried that if I don't get the basics down now, the STAT 4XX courses starting next term will slaughter me.

Any textbook recommendations that can take me back to the basics starting from STAT 231 all the way to STAT 331? Should I just keep reading the class notes until I get it? Should I be focusing on going to the tutorials for examples?

I have went to all the classes I can and took physical notes each class (except when interviews conflicted with classes) but I just don't understand what the professor is saying. If I go to them in office hours and tell her I've been to class but don't understand much, would they be willing to help me?

I feel I am fairly strong with probability-based courses like STAT 230 and 330 but these statistics and inference based courses (like STAT 231, 331, 332) are literally killing me.

58,Ace ANY Facebook Interview Without Memorizing Solutions,"Ace ANY Facebook Interview Without Memorizing Solutions

I've made a short guide to solving tough interview questions using what I've learned over the years.

Part 1: Tactics

Types of Statements:

1. Choice: if, else if, else
2. Automation: for, forEach, while, map
3. Keywords and Standard Libraries (in this case, I’ll use JavaScript): null vs undefined, == vs ===,  parseInt(), isNaN(), JSON.parse(), JSON.stringify(), Array.prototype.indexOf(), String.prototype.indexOf(), Array.protoype.sort(), etc.

Part 2: Strategies

Types of Questions:

1. String and Arrays
2. Trees and Graphs
3. Recursion and DP

Tools:

Hashmap - O(1) read, O(1) deletion

Hashset - O(1) existency, O(1) deletion

Queue - iterative alternative to recursion

Stack -  iterative alternative to recursion

Binary Search Tree - O(log(n)) insertion, O(log(n)) deletion

Linked List - O(1) insert and O(1) deletion at ACCESSIBLE elements in a list

Min/Max Heap - O(log(n)) insertion, O(1) remove min/max

Part 3: Good Advanced Algorithms to know

Strings and Arrays:

1. Binary Search: O(log(n)) search in a sorted array.

Trees and Graphs:

1.BFS (iteratively and recursively) and DFS (recursively): Visit all nodes of interest in a graph.

2. Dijkstra’s Algorithm: Find the shortest path between two nodes.

3. Prim’s Algorithm: Find the minimum spanning tree.

Recursion and DP:

1.Consider the following question - solve it by storing computed values in memory, then accessing them to avoid recomputation:

You are climbing a stair case. It takes n steps to reach to the top.

Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

Part 4: Picking Questions

Why do questions...? Work = Profit?? ...No

Reasons to fail a question:

1. Weak tactics: You don’t know the standard language libraries well enough, so even if you know the algorithm to use, you can’t implement it.

Solution: Pick leetcode easy questions that use common tactics. Maybe, at the start, you have to look up some keywords/libraries. That’s ok. Keep doing them until you don’t have to.

2. Poor strategy:  You don’t know which tools to use or you even forget what tools are applicable.

Solution: Memorize the list of tools and the best case use for all of them. Attack leetcode medium questions and think: 1) Can a best-use tool solve this 2) Can I break the problem down into segments that can be solved with different tools.

3. Poor Advanced Knowledge:The question expects you to know a well known algorithm that is difficult to come up with in a short time.

Solution: Read about, watch videos on, and practice questions with well-known algorithms.",https://www.reddit.com/r/uwaterloo/comments/g2dwol/ace_any_facebook_interview_without_memorizing/,g2dwol

and my laptop in my lap, 

Had just settled my brain for a long google forms nap, 

When out of my laptop there arose such a clatter, 

I jumped in my bed wondering what was the matter, 

Away to my laptop I flew like a flash, 

And now to the keyboard I furiously mash, 

With outlook open I spy an email now fresh, 

I knew in a moment it must be a match,

My interest lies in Computer Science but, I was unable to transfer because of low grades. I am a pretty good self-learner and decent at software development and in fact, all my past co-ops have been as a Software Developer for decent companies. After getting rejected from CS, I thought I would major in Stats because that would help me in the future but, the more I do it, the more I dislike the content and frankly not really into it. I am at this point where my grades are shit (low 60s) and I don't know what to do.

Should I switch schools and apply for transfer in some CS program since my interest lies in that or just do a major like Computational Mathematics and finish my degree. Also even if I want to transfer to another school, I am not sure which school will take me with low grades that I have. Personally, I like the university, the co-op program, the student design teams, engineering aspects, and just many smart people.

I worked at a job in Machine Learning because I thought it would be useful to do, and it sounded interesting. I worked with a couple of other coops. I never had had any experience in Machine Learning and I was absolutely a noob at it all. My previous coop was as a QA analyst and I never got to do anything useful, only refactoring code here and there. So I didn't learn much about a large codebase, or creating new things. I just kind of screwed around, arriving late and leaving early as soon as possible, and slacking off during the day. And I did the same thing with this Machine Learning job.

I just don't know what to do to be honest with you. I tried learning Android development during coop, but then figured iOS development would be easier, so I tried to switch to that - but didn't have any Mac OS X computer - so I looked on ebay for Macs and they were expensive.. In the end I just gave up and started playing video games.

A couple months ago, I was doing some leetcode problems and have completed about 200 (usually after consulting the solution). But I don't even know if this is what I want to be doing with my life. 

What should I do? There are so many people that are successful in life, take youtube stars like PewDiePie or Nigahiga, they are just in their 20s/early 30s, and they are millionaires at this point. I look up to them so bad, but I don't have any video editing skills or anything interesting to talk about. I don't have any real skills. I'm not even good at gaming to become a professional gamer or anything like that. 

I could get into real estate where people have made lots and lots of money (millionaires) but it takes so long to do and I probably wouldn't be able to with my lack of people skills.

I just have no idea what would be the best way to spend the rest of my life. Should I spend it coding or doing something else? I am just wasting my time nowadays with no real purpose.

I've thought of just staying with my parents for the rest of my life and playing games all day long. But I don't even know if that's the right choice. I don't feel like I am able to do anything of any use. Sometimes I even think about suicide. Wouldn't that be the easy way out of all of this?

I just don't know how to be an adult, how to retain friends, get a girlfriend, or become good at a job. I lack discipline. I lack guidance. Please, someone help me out.",https://www.reddit.com/r/uwaterloo/comments/g97p8t/i_dont_know_what_to_do_with_my_life/,g97p8t

I honestly lost count of the amount of times she laughed at things that I said and she seemed to genuinely enjoy talking to me. We ended up chatting for nearly an hour, and most of our conversation wasn’t even remotely about Facebook—just random things about ourselves. Towards the end of the interview, I had a strange urge to go in for a kiss. It’s as though I completely forgot that this was an interview for co-op, and my desires got the best of me. I guess I completely misread the situation too, as she immediately shouted “what are you doing?” as I was doing so. I instantly apologized and we kind of ended things awkwardly then and there.

96,Why did they make life so hard for Engineering? Questions from a CS student,"I'm a 2nd yr CS student and know the general environment in UW, but I dont know that much about eng. A few things are confusing to me about eng that dont seem to happen in CS:

1. The term fail thing seems too harsh. You fail 1 course in eng and u gonna repeat some other courses as well as the failed ones, which just doesnt seem fair. What is the purpose of this besides perhaps UW being greedy for money?

2. Seems like Eng profs aim for a lower class avg than cs. Despite math 115/117 content being ""easier"" than 135 and 137(in my personal opinion after going through both math 135 and 137 and carefully reviewing math 115 and 117 courseware from an eng friend), the 11x exams seem trickier and designed for lower average. Why is this necessary? Is there a quota that they must screw over enough students?

3. Eng has mandatory 6 course/even some 7 course semesters, with difficult courses as well. With the exception of SE and part of CE, not many job opportunities are targeted towards eng on waterlooworks since most are software jobs. Why are people competing to get into such programs with difficult courses and coops(especially first ones), when they can get better opportunities in math/CS?

In a sense I am vindicating for the engineers, having myself enjoyed a program which is not that much more, if any more, difficult to get into compared to an eng program, but with much more freedom(options), less work(5 course semester), and better coop opportunities(my first coop is programming, pays 25 an hour and I got it with ~80 avg, no leetcode or project).",https://www.reddit.com/r/uwaterloo/comments/eetaa8/why_did_they_make_life_so_hard_for_engineering/,eetaa8

I have finished my 1B term, and will be entering my 2A term for Winter 2020 (the next term).

My first coop job is scheduled for the term after I complete my 2A term, so Summer 2020.

The only programming knowledge I have is what I learned in CS135 and CS136.

I took an off term so that I can RELAX from the mental pressures of school, and not have to do any work.

But I now find that I am bored af, and am even more bored from doing nothing than I am from doing school work (which I find to be the most boring thing ever).

So I would rather be doing something rather than nothing.

As today is the drop deadline, I had already dropped all of my courses and it is too late to go back now.

So I may as well salvage the situation by using this time productively to better myself personally, and to develop new skills and do side projects that will help me get my first coop job.

So what do you guys recommend? 

Like what are the useful programming languages to learn to get your first coop job?

And what is something that I can do as a side project? 

What is grinding leetcode, and how does this help?

111,Some Painful Truths about Cali,"stop converting USD to CAD for salary comparisons

why? you can't save what you don't have, if I could save $3k USD/month in the US then that'd be my benchmark

> Toronto and Vancouver have significantly lower COL than SF or NYC

lower CoL? yes.

significantly? umm debatable

from looking up online it seems that if I were to stay, I'd be trading 25-30% CoL discount but at a 200-300% salary discount

>There’s no Canadian city like SF

>if you’re aiming to go for a top 25-30% salary then the US has a higher salary ceiling

exactly my point, if no Canadian company's willing to offer what I'm looking for, that's perfectly alright: I'll just go to where there are companies willing to offer that

by that logic, FAANG in the US pays much more, you can't compare Big N in Canada vs. non-Big N in US and say ""see? Canada pays a lot""

afaik, non-Big Ns vs. non-Big Ns you're looking at maybe 60k CAD (~45k USD) vs. 100k USD

if you're comparing Big N vs. Big N then it's probably around 120k CAD (~90k USD) vs. 170k USD

the numbers doesn't make sense regardless how you look at it

are you saying that you can get $100k+ USD (~$130k CAD) as a fresh grad in Canada working at non-Big Ns? because I don't buy that

my point being that number is easily do-able in the US

I'm only comparing SF Bay Area/Seattle/NYC vs. Toronto/Vancouver, the largest tech hubs in each country. I view $100k USD as the minimum salary for SF while I know I'd get laughed out the door if I tried to demand even ~$75k USD ($100k CAD) in Toronto

I just say something along the lines of ""no thanks I'm too busy interviewing with companies who only asks me 1h (leetcode) of my time""

135,Another stupid interview story to give you hope,"I didn't greatly enjoy my first co-op term and made sure to apply to about 45 jobs during second round (in faculty of arts/environment). I aimed for more senior/technical positions that I wasn't really well-equipped for, but also included a lot of ""safety net"" jobs just in case. I ended up getting one interview from the cooler jobs, and got - NO KIDDING - 12 interviews for a plethora of low-level admin shitty jobs. Some of these interviews even required several steps and I had to prepare powerpoint presentations...they were horrible.

The ""Golden Egg"" technical job interview, marked senior, was my last interview of first round. At this point I'm extremely sick of interviewing, midterms are kicking my ass, and I'm just losing it. But I'm SO EXCITED. I get to the interview and there's a male and female interviewer. It's scheduled for 45 minutes, I walk in only to be greeted by the man, let's call him Robert, telling me: ""you are the last interview of the day. We are extremely tired, to be frank with you, and have been doing this for hours. We also wouldn't usually ever interview a student for their second coop since this is a more senior role, but your cover letter was interesting and we wanted to hear what you have to say.""

At this point I'm thinking, fuck it, now is the time to prove myself. All the odds are against me. I try to flex any and all relevant info I have towards the role, industry, etc. throwing in random jokes that crack the female interviewer up (but the male interviewer still looks bored). Finally, as I feel the interview come to an end, I say:

""Listen, I know I'm the youngest candidate you're interviewing. If there is any impression I could leave you with, it's that I am a hard worker and I pick things up quickly. I've got a mind like a sponge."" The interviewers awkwardly say ""Okay...thank you for taking the time to interview with us.""

I stand up and walk backwards out of the interview room, keeping eye contact with Robert, and say: ""Don't forget, ROBERT - mind like a sponge. Mind, like a sponge..."" and tap my head as I say this, then close the door. I am still horrified to this day, but my friends love the story.

136,Funny/weird interview story,"I just wanted to share the story of my first co-op interview at Waterloo for any first years struggling with interviews since it’s an extremely odd story. I’d love to hear other people’s funny interview stories as well.

Anyways, in 1B main round I got only one interview and I was super excited and spent A LOT of time preparing for it. The day of the interview comes and I’m sooo nervous. Right away I’m given some programming question and I completely blank out and didn’t do any of it. Then the guy interviewing me gave me a whiteboard logic question to do and I blanked out again and just stood there facing the whiteboard for so long without saying anything. Then out of no where, the interviewer has an alarm on his watch that sets off and he immediately starts freaking and gets up and sprints out of the room with a lottttt of blood running out of his nose. So I’m just standing there so confused for a while and he comes back, and I legit am not exaggerating one bit, but his face is FULLY covered in blood. I mean the man legit looked like a zombie, I don’t understand how or why he didn’t clean his face, I’m guessing he didn’t see himself in the mirror lool. He said he had some condition where his nose starts bleeding intensely or something. Anyways the rest of the interview I kept trying to hold back my laugh cause the man literally looked like he just killed someone and ate them alive, but I couldn’t stop laughing so I kept pretending I was coughing while covering my face while I laughed loool. Anyways the interview finally finished and as you can guess I didn’t get ranked.

This was my first term getting an external offer and I followed CECA's guidelines for adding the offer to my rankings by submitting it after the first cycle interview start date. However, when CECA contacted the employer to confirm this, the employer told CECA that they thought I was already accepting their offer.

So naturally, CECA believes them and promptly blocks my access to WaterlooWorks without confirming anything with me. This entire time when my access is blocked, I'm also blocked from receiving any interviews from my applications. Any employer that wanted to interview me was told that I was unavailable.

I had to go back and forth with CECA this past week in order to gain access to WaterlooWorks again and they still told me the earliest they could grant access is next Monday. So I automatically lose all interviews from any company that was giving them out this week. I'll continue to lose any interviews I'm selected for until CECA manages to unblock my access.

All this happened because I submitted my form early due to my advisor pressuring me to after I asked him for advice on how to go about this. If I had just waited until the middle of the first cycle before submitting it as I originally planned, this wouldn't have happened. 

TLDR: If you submit your AOJ form early, CECA might lock you into that job and to unlock yourself, you lose any interviews scheduled up until that point.",https://www.reddit.com/r/uwaterloo/comments/etk9ch/psa_if_you_want_to_add_an_external_job_offer_to/,etk9ch

169,Some personal thoughts? I guess,"Since there’s a lot going on right now in terms of social justice, human rights and black lives matter, I wanted to share some thoughts of something particular. As well as it’s pride month, and as a lgbt+ individual there’s a lot to work to be done to achieve true equality even and especially within the community. If members within the community can’t love each other and treat all gays with respect, whats the point of others trying to have respect for us. 

I just wanted to address the racism and prejudice behaviours within the community (that I’ve personal witnessed and experienced on multiple occasions). I’ve been with the community for a while now and I’m not saying it’s all bad but in Waterloo I’ve never experienced anything like it. This experience is from dating apps btw, specifically Grindr. Anyways in places like Toronto I’ve rarely experienced racism within the Grindr community. Heck even when I went to NYC for a week (a predominately white city), it was pretty nice to see gays not being racist. 

I’m not sure why Waterloo is like this really (maybe it’s the town or country boys??) but it’s not just the white gays (even tho they make up majority). I’ve witnessed minorities speak negative of other minority and claim it as a “preference” which I call bullshit btw. Also did u know that Grindr had a “preference” option? they recently removed it because of the BLM movement. 

Btw this is not to attack any gays but I just wanted to simply share my thoughts and feelings about the community (on a localized level). Just to confirm my theory one day I decided to catfish as a mediocre white boy, just to see any difference in attraction from other men. The results weren’t surprising, the incoming messages were like 5x more than my regular account. Also IM SORRY FOR CATFISH! I promise I deleted the profile after 2 days and I’ll never do it again. 

Overall, it is just interesting to see this type of behaviour, especially within an oppressed community. I honestly am conflicted over “preferences”, like is that racist or not? I’ve seen majority provide strong evidence that it is, through numerous posts of twitter. It is also not just racism that the community faces, but it is the biggest factor. 

Ive experienced this first hand and it’s just like if you’re not masculine, ain’t got a cute face or some sets of abs, then the community treats u as “something to ignore”. The same reason I started to hit the gym tho and maybe it’s to get validated by other guys and simply not for myself but RIP 2020 gains tho :(

I’m also sure the straight community as experienced similar types of racism. Also like I said, this seems to be Waterloo problem (Laurier and UW boys be acting the same) but I’m sure many areas might be like this. 

I’m not acting jealous or undermining the other gays (or just people in general) it’s just frustrating sometimes that even within the lgbt+ community there’s many discriminatory actions that many of us face with. It’s also REALLY hard to find a man/boyfriend due to this factor but imma keep trying.

I hope you guys try to get what I’m saying? I know some things may seem choppy and unclear but my mind is just all over the place right now.

180,Hist 216 - online filler course for summer.,"If you're looking for filler courses for the spring term, HIST 216 History of the Internet might be a consideration.   It's a fully online course.

I'm reluctant to use the word bird course, because the prof is better than that, but:

\- easy marking.

\- easy material. It's not just memorizing dates, a lot of it is just doing a bit of thinking about impacts of various events.

\- prof is enthusiastic.  Out of three online courses I've taken, this was the only one where I didn't have a tendency to fall behind because the prof is interacting with us all the time.

\- a lot of the course is online participation and readings, all on a weekly basis.  If you're comparing to class time, there's no video lectures, just readings every week.  I spent 2-3 hours per week on the course, generally saturday mornings :).  that let me do the readings and do my participation (which is pretty much the full extent of the course), and do reasonably well markwise.  So if you're OK doing readings and typing up 500 words once a week, you've got the course pretty much covered.

\- the only caveat is that this is not a course where you can ignore everything until a few days before the final. The material is quick enough to grasp in order to do that, but it's not structured in that fashion.  It's not hard, but you do need to work on it every week.

Further to the prof, when school shut down for a week his response was to exempt everyone from that week's assignments - we got the week off.  Final exams was supposed to be 2 questions, he outlined pretty clearly what woudl be asked.   When finals went online he changed it to just a take home essay question and has already told us it'll be look like the questions we've already been pointed to. (also, I completely screwed up an assignment - like answered a completely different question. They marked me based on what I answered rather than what I was supposed to answer :) ).

im taking fr 251:grammar online and im realizing that the lecture component is actually terrible so im wondering if the in class version is any better. here is my experience:

firstly whoever organized the online course really half-assed it. there are videos to teach the concepts but theres never really many examples on screen. he mostly rambles on a lot and it doesnt feel like a formal and concise explanation (for a visual learner who only took french in high school this is hell). this is of course in comparison to fr192a &b that i both took online that had multiple examples for each concept, online activities to practice AND a textbook. even if there's a textbook available i feel that i wouldn't be asking too much to learn from the actual course.

in addition ive already failed two out of the 4-5 tests and the first two tests so im feeling like there not much hope for the rest of the course.

anyways if anyone has taken fr251 in class could tell me if its the same kind of situation? i truly feel that grammar is not something one easily learns online (even first language english speakers struggle with grammar)  so id like to know how the in class is structured and if it is superior to the online version",https://www.reddit.com/r/uwaterloo/comments/ex2h9m/french_251/,ex2h9m
186,I am at a loss and I am on the verge of surrendering,"*I am vague on my program, marks, term etc cause i know those whom browse the subreddit and i dont want to give myself away*


I have had a rough week, maybe even month and i dont know how much longer i can take. 

It has been building up arguably since 1A and now im halfway through this semester and my most recent mark really has me doubting me, what i can offer and what even is my purpose in this world.

I always said i am a 90+ student, my whole life i excelled, I always knew more than needed, missed 4 days my entire school career and had my career set out of passion. Knew it would be a long path especially with my career involving postgrad, but i came in with poise and hunger to prove the stigma about undergrad regarding marks dropping after coming into uni being a norm. Asked questions about how to overcome this obstacle made friends with upper year dons during my first year so i can get tips from those with experience and have been through these struggles. All for 60s and 70s. I got 2 marks over 85+ and only ONE midterm over 90 so far in my schooling career.

My latest mark that has caused this emotional turmoil is a mark on a midterm worth 30%, and i studied my heart out for it, memorized the ins and outs, made flash cards, rewrote my notes and reviewed all topics and had friends quiz and i had down all the facts to the tee. I came in confident to the midterm, (something i lacked all 1st year as i never came in composed and was scared before, during and after the exam) this time i felt calm, before and during and after the exam. Out of the whole MC test i had 13 iffy ones (questions which i gave them time and read but i didn’t know the answer off the bat and even after elimination i had been undecided, yet the remaining question i knew right away or i would be able to cancel 4 choices out and the have one answer left).

Marks come out and class average was 68% but i had barely passed, an exam that i thought i confidently can get +83% i calculated and almost for sure knew i that was the bare minimum. But i got in the range of 50%-55% which hurt a-lot, i never felt more out of it and tired and done and just ready to raise the white flag, cause i had experiences of cramming and getting a ~70% and wouldn’t complain cause thats on me. But this time around i made sure i had closed all doors for excuses and studied my ass off and the result... barely passing. Also it was a biology test, and it was 6 topics each about different organisms function, structure, interaction like there is no trickery its you know or you dont no open ended questions.

My parents arent having it, saying i always get +90% on my quizes, assignments, clickers and all the side marks and all is well but when midterms and finals come i never can translate those marks and always end up with courses with ~70s and even a high 60 once. I spoke to my mom and had told her i got mid 70s just above average (i got 50-55) and she told me “I disappoint her, good night”... which left a grown man broken and still hurts to think of it. 

I am reaching out cause i have two second midterms in 2 weeks and i need to do kill them cause i genuinely feel like i hit rock bottom and if i dont end up doing good and getting a morale boost before finals my moms vision of me, my mental health my ambition along with my 78.4 average and good academic standing will come flying down with me.

188,"5 Problems 1st years at UWaterloo deal with, and the best and worst ways to handle them.","**1. GETTING LOWER THAN EXPECTED GRADES IN YOUR 1ST SEMESTER**

**The Problem:** Chances are, no matter how intelligent you are, your grades may drop during your first year here. Please understand this means your life is over. Getting a 65% of the CHEM120 midterm will shut the door to all future opportunities (academic or work related). First semester grades are universally seen as the most important factor in determining future success.

**The Solution:** The only way to prevent this, is to approach your TA and explain to them that you are actually one of the smartest kids in your class back in high school and thus don't deserve this mark. The TA will be really impressed, because pretty much no one in UW was considered 'smart in high school', and will immediately revise your tutorial assignment to a 95%. Remember, you are the only person in the entire school facing this problem.

**What Not to Do:** Do not waste time doing things like calming down, putting things into perspective, or assessing what you could do in the future improve your grades. Though these things may seem rational, they will actually just cause you to calm down, which is bad. Students do best when they're in a constant state of panic.

**2. BEING IN A CO-OP STREAM BUT HAVING NO WORK EXPERIENCE**

**The Problem:** You are in the co-op program, and your older cousin told you that was great and really important. But aside from the 40 hours of community service you did in high school selling samosas to raise money to build birdhouses for the homeless, you don't really have anything to land your first co-op job.

**The Solution:** Who cares? Your first co-op is like a year away, which means it might as well not exist. Do not attempt to seek out opportunities on campus to help you gain some volunteering or work experience to put on your future resume. Instead just spend your free time during the day watching Netflix and playing video games. When your co-op semester finally does roll around, frantically email research labs and every club on campus asking if they need a volunteer. Hopefully the 3 hours you spent sitting at a booth at SLC for the Saskatchewan Students Association, might help you land one of those sweet jobs as a PD TA that school puts out during continuous round.

**What Not to Do:** Spend a couple hours a week, engaging in a productive resume building activity such as volunteering, working on a side project, getting a part time job etc. That WHMIS certification thing you got of Learn is all you need to impress Deloitte.

**3. FEELING OVERWHELMED BY YOUR COURSE LOAD**

**The Problem:** Your studying seems like it never ends. You just submitted a major assignment, but there's no time to breath because you've got 2 midterms this week as well. It honestly feels like someone flipped a switch, 1 minute you were doing frosh week games the next you were skipping class to study for the class you just skipped.

**The Solution:** Just study harder. Ignore your feelings and mental well being, those things have no impact on you. Pull away from friends and family, stop doing the things you love, avoid exercise, hygiene, and healthy eating and focus all your attention on studying.

**What Not to Do:** Do not attempt to re-assess your capabilities, recognize it's unrealistic to expect all 90s in university, or attempt to create a balanced work-life balance that would help you stay more focused and less overwhelmed. And don't even think about seeking mental health care and support. Scientists and doctors may have a mountain of evidence showing mental health concerns are real healthcare issues, but scientists and doctors are all liars. Just tough it out. Brains are like the least useful organ.

**4. HAVING TROUBLE MAKING FRIENDS**

**The Problem:** Making friends was never your strong suit, back in high school you had your childhood friends but here you just feel awkward and out of place. And you don't know anyone. You worry you may not make any new friends and spend university alone.

**The Solution:** You don't need friends! Avoid everyone. Ignore your floor mates, and go straight home after class. People will eventually think your very mysterious and cool and try to be your friend, this is how it is in anime. If you're a guy, just play more video games. If you're a girl just watch 'School of Life' videos over and over in hopes you will overcome the natural emotions everyone has.

**What Not to Do:** Do not convince yourself that the first few weeks of university are the best time to make friends because no one else knows anyone either. Do not try and get to know as many people as possible and instead clinging to that 1 guy on your floor you went to high school with. Do not attempt to overcome any shyness you may have, because that is impossible. Do sit in your room and convince yourself that everyone at UWaterloo is an extroverted party animal and that you are the only person on campus who isn't into that kind of stuff, while 100s of other students also sit in their room thinking identical thoughts.

**5. HAVING TROUBLE GETTING YOUR SHIT TOGETHER**

**The Problem:** You used to have structure thrust upon you. High school's tighter timelines and your mom's nagging helped you keep it together. But away from all that, you're ignoring studying (you can just do an all-nighter and learn 12 weeks of content in 12 hours right?), eating like shit, not exercising and either going overboard with either partying or gaming/internet.

**The Solution:** This is what university is for, you will never regret not taking university more seriously in the future. This years aren't important. If you insist on changing just use motivation. If you really want to, you can just get it together.

**What Not to Do:** Ignore the growing body of evidence that suggest motivation is futile in changing yourself, and instead taking control of your habit formation patterns is the best way to improve yourself. Do not recognize that all habits follow a cue -> action -> reward pathway and that changing this can make it very easy to break old patterns of behavior and learn new ones. Do not read 'The Power of Habit' by Charles Duhigg because this entire post was just subtle product placement.",https://www.reddit.com/r/uwaterloo/comments/cvrzib/5_problems_1st_years_at_uwaterloo_deal_with_and/,cvrzib

I also had another midterm after this one so I was just super out of it (please don't ask me why this happened.. I had a mental breakdown or something)

In terms of how I'm doing in the course, I got an 89% on the first test, but after that I've been getting mid-50s to mid-60s. If I WD and retake; I probably will find a tutor.

Do you think I should WD this course and retake it again, or should I take a risk and bank on the 100% final?

In terms of whether or not I think I can do it; I think I might be able to but perhaps the way the course is structured, I'm really having a hard time understanding concepts and the textbook only confuses me more.",https://www.reddit.com/r/uwaterloo/comments/dwl23i/should_i_wd_from_stat230/,dwl23i

I'm sure that some others may have a different experience. But I'm not happy with how vague they are being.

216,Waterloo CS non-Coop vs uOttawa data science (CS and Math Double Degree),"Hey guys,

Today, I got my acceptance to the Waterloo regular CS program. I applied as a transfer student for the CS coop program however, they said I wouldn’t be eligible for the coop option due to my advanced standing (too many transfer credits). I was previously accepted to uottawa data science program which is a double degree program for math and CS. The program is quite new so they don’t currently have the coop option but based on my communications with them, coop will likely become available in the coming years. 

Which program do you guys think I should pick and how hard would it be for me to land jobs in major tech companies?",https://www.reddit.com/r/uwaterloo/comments/h016dy/waterloo_cs_noncoop_vs_uottawa_data_science_cs/,h016dy

222,Following provincial guidelines based on statistical data doesn't make sense in the real world. (Call for action),"There are a lot of idiots running around who're not getting tested due to fear of stigma, paranoia about commercial healthcare and what not, or escaping their quarantine just because they lack the basic empathy towards society. 6ixwars posted a video of some dude taking off his mask and rubbing his spit on the support bars in some public transport (probably TTC train). I STRONGLY believe classes should be moved online until the situation is better because THE PROVINCIAL GUIDELINES ONLY ACCOUNT FOR THE RECORDED STATISTICS AND REPORTED CASES, AND DO NOT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT HUMAN STUPIDITY. LIKE FOR ONCE ENOUGH WITH THE MATH, USE FUCKING BASIC HUMAN PSYCHOLOGY TO MAKE DECISIONS.

When it comes to Waterloo though, we students are not human beings. As reported by someone on this sub, they will only respond when one of us is ACTUALLY suffering from corona. But I ask WHY. WHY SHOULD EVEN A SINGLE ONE OF US CONTRACT CORONAVIRUS? WHY SHOULD ONE OF US BE THE SACRIFICIAL GOAT FOR THE REST TO BE SAVED?

The danger is imminent and real. Administrations tend to look at this stuff at the macro level, also taking into consideration the economics, and logistics of somehow keeping the machinery running. But as in any machine, one tiny bad part can ruin it. 

If they used their head even a little bit, and looked at the situation with a little bit of humanity, they'd know that a lot of us students are still dumb as shit and will unfortunately be the carriers of Corona on campus, thereby infecting everyone. Like seriously, the administration might be above 40 years of age, but they shouldn't be projecting their own ""We're responsible and won't spread it"" mindset on students who just got out of their fucking teens. Not to forget a lot of those same teens currently work in food services and have been caught coughing like shit on their shifts.

Hence the call for action. In light of the University's apathy so far, we have to take control of the situation. We have to somehow stop the spread to our campus. And the only way I truly see how is to 

## #staythefuckhome. 

Empty out those classrooms.

Pack your shit and get out of those libraries. 

Stop buying food from Food Services. 

Use the hashtag, spread the word. We might not be able to stand next to each other in protest outside DP this time (you obviously know why) but don't underestimate the power of the internet. We're blessed that in such a time, we can mobilize as a united front without stepping outside because of the internet. Use it, spread the word.

Also the fact remains that more than half of you are retards and will go to Ezra on Tuesday. I reckon there will be atleast one case contracted from Ezra in the coming days. I cannot stop you and won't waste energy and words in trying. But if you do go, please don't come to campus after.

Coronavirus is coming to campus whether you like it or not. It is only a matter of when. Until the university responds, save yourself and stay home. Your health is more important than your grades, don't be stupid. And don't let the University tell you otherwise. Do you really wanna be on the Dean's honors list if the university didn't take any steps and you had to suffer through the quarantine treatment? Would you even BE on the Dean's honors list in that case? Use your heads for once. Be safe, be smart. And be brave and step up to ask for what y'all rightfully deserve, which is a safe and healthy environment to complete our education. It is not ethically right for them to force us to attend lectures with 200 stupid kids in the face of a literal pandemic. And remember, the virus may affect older people more but our generation is more outgoing and social, and interacting with so many people on a daily basis (also hookups no offense). We're possibly at a higher risk of being carriers and spreading it like wildfire instead of contracting it ourselves. But that's a risk we can mitigate.

Thank you for coming to my TED talk. I hope I raised some good points to convince you. Corrections/Counter-Arguments are welcome. The more we talk about it the sooner the issue sees some resolution.",https://www.reddit.com/r/uwaterloo/comments/fho7b7/following_provincial_guidelines_based_on/,fho7b7

243,Comprehensive Guide to AFM based on my experiences,"I've seen a lot of questions about AFM, what the program is like, and what the workload is like. As a current MAcc student, I thought I would weigh in for anyone who wants to know what AFM is like. BTW, i went the accounting route, so if you're looking for finance, this may not be for you.

From my experiences, I found the first two years to be a lot more challenging, and third and fourth years to be a lot more chill. The content was harder in upper years, but either I learned how to study or the exams got a lot easier. Also, coop is a blessing and can set you up for life, if you can find the right opportunity. Employers don't really care as much about grades, but more about who you are as a person, whether you're social  skills are good, and whether you'll be a good fit in the office. Therefore, extracurriculars and the interview process are a lot more important than grades. 

Also, I know the joke is that a lot of AFM students are snakes, and some are, but if im being honest, there are a lot of great people too. Just up to you to meet them. Also, most AFM students dont really talk. Start talking to each other, get to know each other, and get rid of those little cliques that always form. 

1A - FALL 

 AFM 101 - Into to Accounting: Basics of accounting, what is an asset, liability, equity, etc. Get's into statement of cash flows and bonds and other types of accounting as well. From what I have heard, they've made this course a lot harder now but that's because of exams, not content 

AFM 131 - International Business - When I took it, this course was a joke, and the only part that required effort was a project called ""Mikes Bikes."" However, that project has been scrapped, but from what I understand, this is a basic course. 

INTST 101 - International Studies - Not a difficult course, but lots of reading and writing involved. Can do fine if you manage your time and do the work. You can also take an elective instead of this, which is what I did. 

MATH 109 - Just a basic math course, do the work and you'll be fine. Not challenging at all 

ECON 101 - Intro to Micro: Gets challenging near the end, but the exams are very fair and all multiple choice. Not hard to do well in. Probably attended 5 lectures combined between ECON 101 and 102. 

1B - WINTER 

AFM 102 - Managerial Accounting: First exposure to managerial accounting. You learn about different types of costs, budgets, and how to make managerial decisions (make/buy, special order, etc). Not difficult, but you will not have seen anything like it before

AFM 121 - Intro to Finance: When I took this course, it was a lot about present values, bonds, stocks, mortgages and loans, etc. We did it all on excel, but I think they may have shifted to paper. Need to do the work to be able to do well

ECON 102 - Intro to Macro: Same as ECON 101 in terms of difficulty and amount of work.

STAT 211 - Statistics: They made this course unnecessarily hard when we took it by screwing us on the final, but essentially high school data management with some things added to it (sampling, probability, z scores and t scores, correlation, etc)

SPCOM 111 - Public Speaking: Easiest course in undergrad as long as you're comfortable talking infront of others 

2A - FALL (I took AFM 202 and 204)

AFM 291 - Intermediate Accounting 1: This course screwed over a lot of students. The focus is on assets and revenue, but exams were really hard and it was marked really harshly. This is a course you just have to get through. Try understanding the content more than memorising here. it will help you.

AFM 273 - Managerial Finance 1: Very similar to AFM 121, except this was on paper, and it went a bit more in depth. Takes you into DCF's and WACC

AFM 202 - Tax/Audit: Half the course is intro to taxprep (tax software) and half the course is intro to audit. It essentially preps you for coop where a lot of students either get jobs in tax or audit. 

AFM 204 - Finance: This course was a lot of learning about how to use excel and different finance tools from what I remember, with a massive valuation project near the end. 

Elective: 

2B - SUMMER 

AFM 211 - Connections to Business Context: This is your first case course. You essentially learn to write a case. This is very important as you get into 4th year and MAcc. Midterm and final are both cases. 

AFM 231 - Law: Lots of content in this course, but not too difficult. Essentially an intro to law course.

AFM 241 - IT: You learn how to use R and SQL along with other IT areas. 

AFM 274 - Managerial Finance 2: Takes Managerial Finance 1, and goes more into depth. It also introduces you to options and option models. The content is harder, but it is not that hard to do well. 

AFM 280 - Organizational Behaviour: A very easy course in terms of understanding the content, but there's a lot of terms to remember. They let us use a cheatsheet for exams which made it very easy. One of the easier courses in undergrad. 

3A - FALL: 

AFM 391 - Intermediate Accounting 2: This course focuses on liabilities and expenses, including leases and pensions. They ease up on you here compared to AFM 291, so while the content is the same level of difficulty, people tend to do a lot better

AFM 373 - Cases in Finance: One of the more useless courses in undergrad. No textbook, essentially all cases that are due weekly and taken up in class, and the exams are based on tools you learn in class to solve the cases. TAKE NOTES OR YOURE SCREWED. 

AFM 341 - IT: This IT course talks more about information systems and control environments, and how things can go wrong. You learn about different diagrams (BPMN). Not hard to do well, just a lot of new information. 

AFM 362 - Tax 1: An introduction to tax both personal and corporate. First half you learn what you can and cannot deduct for both personal and corporations, and what you include in income. You also learn about attribution rules. Second half is dedicated to learning about CCPC's and the tax advantages for them and all the different rates. Not too difficult, but a lot of new information. Exams are very fair. If Dan is teaching your section, you'll be fine. 

Elective 

3B - SUMMER 

AFM 311 - Ethics: Similar to AFM 280, not hard content, but just a lot of it, and a lot of terms. Essentially, why do people cheat/commit fraud, and what can you do to stop it. 

AFM 351 - Intro to Audit/Assurance: Teaches a lot of basics in audit and assurance, including assertions, how to test different accounts, etc. If you have worked in audit, this course is very easy. 

AFM 363 - Tax 2: Essentially takes everything you learned in 362 and takes it to the next level. New topics are: residency, HST/GST, SR+ED, Associated corporations, relationships, etc. Dan usually teaches this course, so it is not hard to do well in. 

AFM 481 - Managerial Accounting 2 - Essentially AFM 102 on steroids. Have to do the work and go to class to do well (I did not). One of my lower marks in undergrad.

4A - FALL/WINTER/SPRING 

AFM 333 - International Business: This course is a joke, and one of the easier courses in undergrad. You take it with ARBUS students as well. Just make sure you read the material before exams. 

AFM 433 - Business Strategy: This course is all case based, as you learn how to write strategy cases and different tools (SWOT, PESTLE, etc) that you can use for strategy cases. As long as you follow the frameworks, it is not hard to do well. 

AFM 491 - Advanced Accounting: One of the hardest courses in undergrad. It is essentially all about consolidation and foreign exchange. Go to class, do the work, as questions. No other way around it. 

2 ELECTIVES 

4B - WINTER/SPRING/FALL 

AFM 401 - Accounting Theory: This course is as boring as it sounds. Essentially boils down to why do we need accounting, what role does it play in the world, and why do people act the way they do. Some parts are interesting, but class is a bore. Just make sure to do the readings and the homework. Exams are very fair. 

AFM 462 - Tax 3 (Advanced): I found this to be the hardest course in undergrad. Julie teaches this course and does a very good job. Almost everything you learn is new and advanced. These topics include: Salary vs dividends, shareholder loans, capital gains exemption, wind up of corporations, S85 and S86 elections, partnerships and trusts, etc. You learn how to write tax cases (midterm is a case) as well. If you're taking MAcc, make sure you know how to do this course. All of the tax course in MAcc is based on this.

AFM 479 - Cases and Applications in Finance 2: I have no idea what to tell you about this course other than i have no clue what the hell happened. my section had a prof that was probably the worst prof SAF ever had, and the rumour is he was fired after the term. He fell asleep during our presentations, didn't teach us anything, and did not cover 80% of the material on the exam. We had to get notes from friends that had the other prof

AFM 482 - Performance Management. This course was very easy. Exams were extremely fair. Just a lot of new content, which is not hard at all. Just make sure you read the content and know the terms. No numbers, all theoretical.

I am interested in CS than engineering. And I am good at math (advanced functions;97 and calculus;94 but not vectors) but I am not sure if I would like math program.
I am leaning toward math at UW because CS in first year at UTSC is general and have to overcome POST, in which I hear numerous comments and I am concerned about the place: Scarborough, I heard there are a lot of crimes.

I am thinking of taking math regular, switch to math co-op then switch to CS co-op.
Since math first year courses are exactly th same as CS first year, I would be fine but then from second year it would be data science major in math program so I'll have to take math courses other than data science related courses, which I'm not sure if I'd like them or not.

Questions
1. What is the difference between math and CS program, in detail? Which one will it be better to take between math at UW and CS at UTSC and Engineering I at Mac?
2. How difficult was it to switch from math to CS in 2019 or in the past?
3. How difficult was it to switch from math regular to math co-op in 2019 or in the past?

6. If there is anyone who took or knows, I would like to know how the math courses are in the second year math program.

I have limited time until decision so I'm myself in the research for these programs and the course details. I also asked UW by making phonecall but they said to send email, which also I did but it'll take time. Thank you for your help.

249,How to transfer from Math Co-op to CS Co-op?,"Hey everyone! I was recently accepted into the Math Co-op program but I also applied to CS co-op and didn't hear back yet. To be completely honest, I don't think I'll make it in, but I really want to study CS over math. I'm totally happy with doing Math and will probably end up studying at UW for Math come September, but I'd be more interested in and happier with pursuing CS.  

I read a lot of threads about this specific topic on and outside the UW reddit but felt like asking again anyways for the sake of staying up to date. 

Basically, suppose I study Math at UW from September, what is the process that I would have to take in order to switch into CS Co-op?

I understand that its a very difficult process but id still like to try, so if anyone knows how or has any advice to offer, please let me know below. 

Also if there any current students who entered UW for math but managed to switch into CS, please share your experience below as it would be a major help and insight for myself and many prospective students wondering the same.",https://www.reddit.com/r/uwaterloo/comments/g93ut6/how_to_transfer_from_math_coop_to_cs_coop/,g93ut6

The only other one's I've seen are PM, Data Science, Design, Devops as the other main ones, but a) none of them interest me and b) since I suck at coding and struggle with technical tasks, I know I'll suck at those too. I'm looking for a role that's I guess easier but still important. QA was cool but I don't think I could live with the stigma around QA and tedious manual labour. Any other recommendations?

This is my last coop term (I'm in CS) before I graduate, and I'm pretty upset that I never got a cali job, or a job in the area I wanted.

254,Cheap phone plan with data for coop students,"Cut to the chase. **You need a dual sim phone for this to work**.

The combination of plans include:

* Fido tablet data plan | 4GB | $10/month: This plan does not support call or SMS. However, any extra data used is charged at only $10/GB so it's still much cheaper than other options if you use more than 4GB a month. It was recently $15/month and only 3GB before that. The catch is officially you need a phone plan with Fido to get this plan but there are places that let you skip this.
* Public Mobile cheapest plan | Unlimited SMS | 100 min outgoing call | Unlimited incoming call | $15/month: This plan is for calling and texting. Easy to get. You can buy the sim from Walmart for $10 and activate right away. If you set up auto-pay, you get $2 off a month. For every year you are with PM, you get $1 off. So this costs at most $13 a month.

Since you have two sims, you need a dual phone. It's a very good time to get a new phone if you have been planning to. This is also an extra reason for you to get a new dual sim phone.

The extra saving comes from freezing your PM account when you are away for coop. If you don't top up your account after 30 days, you account is frozen for 90 days before being permanently deleted. So you only have to pay $13 for every 3 months you are away.

**In total, when you are in Canada, you pay $23 before tax a month for 4GB, unlimited SMS, unlimited incoming call, 100 mins out going call and any extra data is only $10/GB. When you are away, you pay $43 every 3 months.**

I'm hoping to get a data analysis position for my next coop,  ideally in financial institutions so 443 might prepare me for that? but I wonder if knowing GLM can help with my chances for getting data interviews in general. (aside from side project & work experiences of course)
